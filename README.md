# To-Do App

Serves as a simple task list to sort your daily tasks.

To me, serves as a start to CRUD, or its long name, Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

This is just a demo, however if you want to, you can fork this repo and build it to how you like it to be.

I will, at irregular times, update the app to make it look better.
